## Abstract

This chapter provides an experience report with a particular focus on lessons learnt emerging from onboarding BSc, MSc and PhD students for empirical research projects and supervising them to design their own.

With the objectives to (1) prepare students as agents of change that master the sustainability competencies and (2) teach students good research methods and proper empirical research design, I provide a list of supervision and onboarding scenarios that have taught me what works and what does not work so well, and how to improve. As guidance, I focus on Exercises that can be used in teaching at all levels, and Supervision scenarios that are more useful for PhD student mentoring.

The chapter discusses aspects related to didactics and pedagogy and show how to tie the ABC of Software Engineering research in synergistically with the sustainability competencies framework and position the work within the leverage points for sustainability. It concludes with recommendations and take-aways for best practices as well as teaching materials and reflections on ethics.
