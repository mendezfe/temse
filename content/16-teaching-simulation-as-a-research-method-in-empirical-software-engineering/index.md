## Abstract

The chapter supports educators and postgraduate students in understanding the role of simulation in software engineering research based on the authors’ experience. This way, it includes a background positioning simulation-based studies in software engineering research, the proposition of learning objectives for teaching simulation as a research method, and presents our experience when teaching simulation concepts and practice. For educators, it further provides learning objectives when teaching simulation, considering the current state of the art in software engineering research and the necessary guidance and recommended learning activities to achieve these objectives. For students, it drives the learning path for those interested in learning this method but had no opportunity to engage in an entire course on simulation in the context of empirical research.
