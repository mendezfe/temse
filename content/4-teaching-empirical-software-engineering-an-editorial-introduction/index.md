## Abstract

Empirical Software Engineering has received much attention in recent years and became a de-facto standard for scientific practice in Software Engineering. However, while extensive guidelines are nowadays available for designing, conducting, reporting, and reviewing empirical studies, similar attention has not yet been paid to teaching empirical software engineering. Closing this gap is the scope of this edited book.

In the following editorial introduction, we, the editors, set the foundation by laying out the larger context of the discipline for a positioning of the remainder of this book.
