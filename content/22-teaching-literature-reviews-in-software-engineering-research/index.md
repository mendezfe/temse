## Abstract

The goal of this chapter is to support teachers in holistically introducing graduate students to literature reviews, with a particular focus on secondary research. It provides an overview of the overall literature review process and the different types of literature review before diving into guidelines for selecting and conducting different types of literature review. The chapter also provides recommendations for evaluating the quality of existing literature reviews and concludes with a summary of our learning goals and how the chapter supports teachers in addressing them.
