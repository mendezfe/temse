## Abstract

Ethnography has become one of the established methods for empirical research on software engineering. Although there is a wide variety of introductory books available, there has been no material targeting software engineering students particularly, until now.

In this chapter, we provide an introduction to teaching and learning ethnography for faculty teaching ethnography to software engineering graduate students and for students themselves of such courses.

The contents of the chapter focus on what we think is the core basic knowledge for newbies to ethnography as a research method. We complement the text with proposals for exercises, tips for teaching and pitfalls that we and our students have experienced.

The chapter is designed to support part of a course on empirical software engineering and provides pointers and literature for further reading.
