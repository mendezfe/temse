## Abstract

Empirical software engineering employs various research methods depending on the research questions, objectives, and the nature of the phenomenon being studied. One of these methods is controlled experiments, which are paramount when the goal is to find causal relationships. This chapter aims to guide educators in designing a course on experimental software engineering. It encompasses the learning goals of the course, the syllabus, the teaching methods, and the assessment activities. Throughout the chapter, we emphasize the lessons we have learned over the years of teaching this course, highlighting both what worked and what did not work.
