## Abstract

Mining software repositories (MSR) has become a popular research area recently. MSR analyzes different sources of data, such as version control systems, code repositories, defect tracking systems, archived communication, deployment logs, and so on, to uncover interesting and actionable insights from the data for improved software development, maintenance, and evolution. This chapter provides an overview of MSR and how to conduct an MSR study, including setting up a study, formulating research goals and questions, identifying repositories, extracting and cleaning the data, performing data analysis and synthesis, and discussing MSR study limitations. Furthermore, the chapter discusses MSR as part of a mixed method study and how to mine data ethically and gives an overview of recent trends in MSR as well as reflects on the future. As a teaching aid, the chapter provides tips for educators, exercises for students at all levels, and a list of repositories that can be used as a starting point for an MSR study.
