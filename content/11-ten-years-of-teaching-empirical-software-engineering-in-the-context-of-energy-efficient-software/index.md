## Abstract

In this chapter we share our experience in running ten editions of the Green Lab course at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The course is given in the Software Engineering and Green IT track of the Computer Science Master program of the VU. The course takes place every year over a 2-month period and teaches Computer Science students the fundamentals of Empirical Software
Engineering in the context of energy-efficient software.

The peculiarity of the course is its research orientation: at the beginning of the course the instructor presents a catalog of scientifically relevant goals, and each team of students signs up for one of them and works together for 2 months on their
own experiment for achieving the goal. Each team goes over the classic steps of an empirical study, starting from a precise formulation of the goal and research questions to context definition, selection of experimental subjects and objects, definition of experimental variables, experiment execution, data analysis, and reporting.

Over the years, the course became well-known within the Software Engineering community since it led to several scientific studies that have been published at various scientific conferences and journals. Also, students execute their experiments using open-source tools, which are developed and maintained by researchers and other students within the program, thus creating a virtuous community of learners
where students exchange ideas, help each other, and learn how to collaboratively contribute to open-source projects in a safe environment.
